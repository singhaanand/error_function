# Project Title

Demonstrate working of the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Description

This solidity code is the solution to the assessment of module 1 of the "ETH PROOF: Intermediate ETH + AVAX Course" by Metacrafters. The requirements of the assessment is:

For this project, write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

In this program, I have created a contract called "functionAndError" which contains a function called "fun()". This function takes an integer value, all three statements viz. assert(), revert(), and require() will allow the complete execution only if the passed integer is positive, even, and greater than 20.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ETHProof.sol). Copy and paste the given code into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.7" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile ETHProof.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ETHProof" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the fun function.
